## Project Statement

This is a household services application.  
It has three types of users: Admins, Professionals, and Customers.  
Admins manage services and users.  
Professionals offer services in various categories.  
Customers book and close service requests.  
Features include login, registration, CRUD operations, and a user-friendly UI.

## Approach

1. Identify entities, attributes, and relationships.
2. Create an ER diagram.
3. Write SQLAlchemy model classes for entities.
4. Set up a Flask app with blueprints for modular routes.
5. Initialize the database, populate sample data, and set up `flask-login`.
6. Implement core features in stages: login, register, and admin, followed by professional and customer features.
7. Test all functionalities thoroughly.
8. Deploy online on Railway.app platform.
